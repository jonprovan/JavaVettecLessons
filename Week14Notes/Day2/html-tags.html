<body>

    <!-- everything in HTML is treated as a box -->

    <!-- a tag indicates the content of whatever is in it -->

    <!-- some tags have preset formatting (that you can override),
         some are just generic "container" tags -->

    <!-- 
        WITH FORMATTING:
        h1-h6 -- heading
        p -- paragraph
        ul/ol -- unordered (bulleted) list/ordered (numbered) list
        table -- for laying out tables

        em -- italics (same as old i tag, em stands for emphasis)
        strong -- bold (same as old b tag)
        sub/sup -- subtext/supertext


        a -- anchor (link) -- see links-and-images.html for these two
        img -- image
    -->

    <!-- 
        WITHOUT FORMATTING:

        Generic:
        div -- generic block tag, just a container, spans the whole page

        span -- generic inline tag

        Semantic:
        -- do exactly the same thing as a div tag, but provide more meaning
        -- use these when you can to make code more readable
        nav -- navigation bar or area
        header -- the header section at the top of your page (NOT HEAD TAG!)
        footer -- footer section at the bottom of your page
        aside -- generally a sidebar or something you want highlighted
        section -- any general section, might include several elements
        article -- some larger group of text, maybe it's a blog post
        main -- usually a container around all the content in an area
     -->

     <!-- tags like h1, p, div, etc. are BLOCK tags
            they take up the entire width of the page
            AND they force whatever tag is next onto the next line -->

    <!-- tags like em, strong, span, etc. are INLINE tags
            they only cover what they surround, not the entire page
            and the don't force anything to go anywhere -->

    <!-- whitespace in HTML is treated differently:
            anything AFTER the first space is ignored,
            and line breaks are considered space -->

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <p>This is a paragraph. <strong>This is a paragraph.</strong> This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. <em>This is a paragraph.</em> This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!-- br is a manual line break -->
    <!-- use it for paragraph formatting, for example, NOT for spacing -->
    <p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5,<br>6, 7, 8, 9, 10</p>

    
    <!-- a bulleted (unordered) list -->
    <ul>
        <li>List Item 1</li>
        <li>List Item 2</li>
        <li>List Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- a numbered (ordered) list -->
    <ol>
        <li>List Item 1</li>
        <li>List Item 2</li>
        <li>List Item 3</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- if you want multiple tags of the same type = p*3 -->
    <!-- if you want to nest shortcuts = section*2>p*3 -->
