// if i wanted to call action I would need to make a new class/ classes all to implement this one

// This is a case where functional programming comes into play, I can make this a functional
// interface and circumvent that issue
public interface MyInterface {

	// I have an interface with just one method
	public void action();

//	public void action2();
